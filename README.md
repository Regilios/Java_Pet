# University pet-project (based on foxminded menthoring course)

This project was focused at the consistent development of Spring technologies. The final version is a MVC model of the 
non-existent institute.
At various stages of development, the technologies described in the README.md of each of the repository branches were applied.
A short list of these (in final version):
- Spring boot (web, data jpa, validation, thymeleaf etc)
- PostgreSQL
- Mapstruct
- Junit with H2 database for unit-testing, springboottest with docker and dbrider for system tests
- Swagger on Springdoc-openapi
